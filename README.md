# Workshop Week 09: Serialisation and IO

**UPDATE Friday 9th May**

Workshop grading is now complete. In your W9 codespace directory please run the following commands if you wish to run the grading script yourself:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/My-UofE/ECM1410-Workshop-09-Instructions/refs/heads/main/grading.zip -o ./grading.zip 
unzip grading.zip
bash ./test_workshop_09/do_grading.sh
```

**UPDATE Monday 17th March**

Judst to say last Friday I also provided a demo user interface class that can be used to test your code. Instructions are at the very bottom of this page. If the test user interface code does not run when used in conjunction with your MessageBoard.java backend, this is indicative of an issue i.e. you may be graded 0 for the workshop. Please visit Harrison 107 between 9:35-12:25 on Tuesday morning if you have an issue you cannot solve yourself. 

A note on exceptions. **The `MessageBoard.java` class is not meant to catch any exceptions** and the methods should throw those as listed in the `MessageBoardInterface.java` (they get handled by the user interface system. 

**UPDATE Friday 13th March** Updated to clarify how to handle exceptions

Please check the additional gudiance on how to deal with the exceptions and implement it in your code.

## MessageBoard java project

In this workshop we are going to create a messageboard application in which users can add and view posts.

Note for this workshop you do not need to work within a java project folder structure and should keep all files in the working directory.

### `Post.java`

We will start by creating a java object class to store the message board posts.

#### TASK 1

In file `Post.java` add the following code:

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

public class Post implements Serializable {

    // Attributes
    private static int idCounter = 0;
    private int postID;
    private String author;
    private String subject;
    private String message;
    private int date;

    public Post(String author, String subject, String message) {
        this(author, subject, message, null);
    }

    public Post(String author, String subject, String message, LocalDate date) {
        this.postID = ++idCounter;
        this.author = author;
        this.subject = subject;
        this.message = message;
        if (date == null) {
            this.date = (int)LocalDate.now().toEpochDay();
        } else {
            this.date = (int)date.toEpochDay();
        }
    }

    public String toString() {
        String result = String.format("Post[postID=%d, author=\"%s\", subject=\"%s\", message=\"%s\", date=%d]", 
                                postID, author, subject, message.replace("\n", "\\n"), date);
        return result;
    }

}
```

**NOTES**

1. The static attribute `idCounter` exists to provide a counter to label the posts with an integer identifier. Each time the constructor is called `idCounter++` increments the counter which is used to provide the next `postID` value.

2. For this example project we record the date each post was made. We can create a post without specifying a date, and in this case the current date is used via a call to `LocalDate.now()`. 

Within the `Post` object the date is stored as an `int` epoch day, (epoch dates/times measure time since 1st January 1970). To convert a java `LocalDate` object to epoch day we use method `.toEpochDay()`.

We can convert a date stored as `int` epoch day back to a `LocalDate` using `LocalDate.ofEpochDay()`.

#### TASK 2

Write a test application `TestPostApp.java` which creates a post with information as below:


| | |
|-|-|
| Author: | `Alex Adam` |
| Subject: | `Help with JavaE` |
|  Message: | `Hi, could anyone help me I need to learn how to code in java!` |

Add code to print the object (using the `toString()` as above). 

As the date in the above posts is unspecified the constructor will use the current date from `LocalDate.now()`.

Look at the printed value of the date (it should be approximately `55*365` days). 

#### `LocalDates`

The following example code shows how we can create a `LocalDate` with a custom date in a variety of ways, and use formatting to customise the way it is displayed. Add the code below to your test app (delete after testing!):

```java
LocalDate date1 = LocalDate.of(2023,3,30); // 30th March 2023
LocalDate date2 = LocalDate.now().minusDays(7); // seven days before today
LocalDate date3 = LocalDate.ofEpochDay(50); // epoch day 50

// create formatter to diplay dates in day/month/year format
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yyyy");

System.out.println(date1.format(formatter));
System.out.println(date2.format(formatter));
System.out.println(date3.format(formatter));
```

#### TASK 3

In the `Post.java` file add the following getters:

 `getPostID` `getAuthor` `getSubject` `getMessage` `getDate`

Also add a method to print a formatted version of the post

```java
    public String toFormattedString() {
        LocalDate postDate = LocalDate.ofEpochDay(this.date);
        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd/MM/yy");
        String result = "\n------------------  Post " + postID + "  -------------------" + 
        "\nAuthor: " + author + 
        "\nDate: " + postDate.format(formatter) + 
        "\nSubject: " + subject + "\n" + 
        "----  Message:  -------------------------------\n" +  
        message + 
        "\n-----------------------------------------------\n";
        return result;
    }
```

Create a method that can save the formatted post as a text file (not serialising it!). Hint refer to the slides from Week 8. 

Check you can open and view the resulting file.

Hint. To write a string to file we use code like:

```java
BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filename));
out.write( "Hello World" );
out.close();
```

Your method should throw any IOException that results from the operation i.e.

```java
public void saveAsTextFile(String filename) throws IOException {
    
}
```

Test by adding the following in `TestPostApp.java`, saving the example post to file `mypost.txt` using a `try` and `catch` as indicated below:

```java
try {
        // code to save the post
} catch( IOException ex ) {
        System.out.println("File not saved.");
        ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

### `MessageBoardInterface.java`

The following file defines an interface for a MessageBoard class. Save this into file `MessageBoardInterface.java`

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.time.LocalDate;

/**
 * The MessageBoardInterface provides methods for managing and interacting with a message board.
 * It allows adding, deleting, searching, displaying, and backing up posts.
 */
public interface MessageBoardInterface extends Serializable {

    /**
     * Retrieves an array of all post IDs on the message board.
     *
     * @return an array of integers representing the IDs of all posts
     *        on the message board or an empty array if there are no posts.
     */
    public int[] getPostIDs();

    /**
     * Adds a post to the message board with the specified author, subject, and message.
     * The current date will be used as the date of the post.
     *
     * @param author  the author of the post (must not be null or empty)
     * @param subject the subject of the post (must not be null or empty)
     * @param message the message content of the post (must not be null or empty)
     * @return the ID of the newly added post
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any of the parameters are invalid
     */
    public int addPost(String author, String subject, String message) throws IllegalArgumentException;

    /**
     * Deletes the post with the specified ID from the message board.
     *
     * @param postID the ID of the post to be deleted
     * @throws IDInvalidException if the post ID is invalid
     */
    public void deletePost(int postID) throws IDInvalidException;

    /**
     * Searches for posts with subjects that contain the specified keyword.
     *
     * @param keyword the keyword to search for in the subjects (case-insensitive)
     * @return an array of post IDs that match the search criteria
     */
    public int[] searchPostsBySubject(String keyword);

    /**
     * Searches for posts within the specified date range.
     *
     * @param startDate the start date of the range (inclusive)
     * @param endDate   the end date of the range (inclusive)
     * @return an array of post IDs that match the search criteria 
     */
    public int[] searchPostsByDate(int startDate, int endDate);

    /**
     * Displays the formatted post with the specified ID.
     *
     * @param postID the ID of the post to be displayed
     * @throws IDInvalidException if the post ID is invalid
     */
    public String getFormattedPost(int postID) throws IDInvalidException;

    /**
     * Backs up the message board to a file.
     *
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs during the backup process
     */
    public void saveMessageBoard(String filename) throws IOException;

    /**
     * Loads the message board state from a backup file.
     * 
     * The current contents of the message board will be replaced by the contents of the backup file.
     *
     * @throws IOException            if an I/O error occurs during the loading process
     * @throws ClassNotFoundException if the class of a serialized object cannot be found
     */
    public void loadMessageBoard(String filename) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;

    /**
     * Saves a post as formatted text to a file.
     *
     * @param postID   the ID of the post to save
     * @param filename the name of the file to save the messages to
     * @throws IDInvalidException if the post ID is invalid
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs during the saving process
     */
    public void savePostAsTextFile(int postID, String filename)  throws IDInvalidException, IOException; 

}
```

### `IDInvalidException.java`

The interface includes a custom exception which is thrown when an interface method is called with an invalid `postID` argument.

To set up the custom exception we need to save the following code in file `IDInvalidException.java`:

```java
public class IDInvalidException extends RuntimeException {
    public IDInvalidException(String m) {
        super(m);
    }
}
```

### `MessageBoard.java`

Write a `MessageBoard` class to implement this interface. 

Start with the following code in file `MessageBoard.java` note that we will not add `implements MessageBoardInterface` until we have finished coding all the methods.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.io.*;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;


public class MessageBoard implements Serializable {
    private List<Post> posts;
    private String boardName;

    public MessageBoard(String boardName) {
        this.boardName = boardName;
        this.posts = new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
```

You can see that the implementation of the messageboard system has attributes of a board name, and a list of posts that have been added. The constructor for the message board, takes the name and sets up a new empty `ArrayList` to store the posts.

The interface has been designed so that it does not directly deal with the Post objects, but can access them via their `postID` identifiers.

#### TASK 4

Add the following code that lets us access the message board data. As several of the interface methods require us to find a post from its `postID` attribute we have added a helper function that takes `postID` and returns its index in the `posts` `ArrayList`. If the `postID` does not exist it throws an `IDInvalidException`:

```java
    public String getBoardName() {
        return boardName;
    }

    public int[] getPostIDs() {
        int[] postIDs = new int[posts.size()];
        int i = 0;
        for (Post post : posts) {
            postIDs[i++] = post.getPostID();
        }
        return postIDs;
    }

    public int getPostIndex(int postID) throws IDInvalidException {
        for (int i = 0; i < posts.size(); i++) {
            if (posts.get(i).getPostID() == postID) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        throw new IDInvalidException("Invalid post ID.");
    }
```

Now we can edit `MessageBoard.java` to add the `addPost()` and  `getFormattedPost()` interface methods:

```java
public int addPost(String author, String subject, String message){
    // this should create a new post and add it to the posts ArrayList
}
```

```java
public String getFormattedPost(int postID) throws IDInvalidException{
    // this should make use of getPostIndex to access the post
    // and print it using the .toFormattedString() method
}
```

To test your `MessageBoard` code create a file `TestMBApp.java`. 

In the main method of this file create a new `MessageBoard` with board name "Coding Support" and use `addPost()` to post the following messages:

| | |
|-|-|
| Author: | `Alex Adam` |
| Subject: | `Help with Java` |
| Message: | `Hi, could anyone help me I need to learn how to code in java!` |

| | |
|-|-|
| Author; | `Belinda Bennett` |
| Subject: | `Help with Java` |
|  Message: | `Hi Alex. Yes I can send some tutorials I found useful.` |

| | |
|-|-|
| Author: | `Cindy Carter` |
| Subject: | `Coding on a Chromebook` |
|  Message: | `Hi, could anyone help me I need to learn how to code in java!` |

| | |
|-|-|
| Author: | `Dennis Dobson` |
| Subject: | `Windows problems` |
|  Message: | `My windows laptop is stuck on a reboot loop. Does anyone know what to do!` |

To check these have been correctly added use `getPostIDs` to retrieve the posts and print them to screen using `getFormattedPost()`.

Check that your test application compiles and runs as expected.

#### TASK 5

Next add the methods `searchPostsBySubject()` and `deletePost()`. 

Hint. As before while searching you can can store the posts within a `List<Post>`, then loop over this to return a `int[]` containing the `postID` values.

In your test application check your methods, by selecting all posts with a subject matching `java` and deleting the posts from the message board. 

After deleting select and print the board messages to check the posts were deleted correctly.

#### TASK 6

Below your existing code in `TestMBApp.java` Add two new posts, but with adjusted dates. 

To do this ou will need to edit `MessageBoard.java` to add a second `addPost` method that can accept a date, e.g. like 

```java
public int addPost(String author, String subject, String message, int epochDate)
```

| | |
|-|-|
| Author: | `Ellie` |
| Subject: | `Java IDE` |
| Message: | `Can someone recommend a Java IDE?` |
| Date: | `20148` (as epoch date) |

| | |
|-|-|
| Author: | `Fred Fansha` |
| Subject: | `Java IDE` |
| Message: | `I just use VS Code` |
| Date: | `20149` (as epoch date) |


Add the method `searchPostsByDate()` and in your test application check that with a `startDate` of `20147` and `endDate` of `20149` you can correctly select just these posts using the method you wrote, and display them.


### Adding `serialisable` to save/load board


#### TASK 7 

The message board is required to have the ability to be serialisable, so it can save its contents to disk, and to restore its state from this file.

Note that when the MessageBoard calls the `loadMessageBoard` loading from the file it should delete all of its existing data and replace it with the loaded data. 

This means that rather than serialising the MessageBoard object, we need to serialise and deserialise its attributes. 

The following shows how we can save the MessageBoard data to file:

```java
public void saveMessageBoard(String filename) throws IOException{
    ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(filename));
    // store boardName attribute
    out.writeObject(boardName);
    // convert posts to array Post[] to simplifies the deserialisation
    Post[] postArray = posts.toArray(new Post[posts.size()]);
    //  store Post array
    out.writeObject(postArray);
} 
```

Write the corresponding `loadMessageBoard()` method which should throw `IOException, ClassNotFoundException` as indicated in the interface.

Hint. Refer to the week 8 slides for how to deserialise. 

You will have to first load the `boardName` and then read in the `Post[]` array.

Check the save method works by saving the MessageBoard to file `codingsupport.ser` at the end of your `TestMessageBoardApp.java`, handling the exception as indicated below

```java
try {
        // code to save the message board
} catch( IOException ex ) {
        System.out.println("Board not saved.");
        ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

Create a second test program called `TestMBLoadApp.java`. This should create a main class that creates a new MessageBoard and uses the load method to restore the posts from the saved file. It should handle the thrown exceptions as indicated below.

```
try {
    // code to load message board
} catch( IOException ex ) {
    System.out.println("Board not loaded.");
    ex.printStackTrace();
} catch( ClassNotFoundException ex ) {
    System.out.println("Could not find class.");
    ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

Check they are loaded correctly by displaying the loaded posts to screen.


#### TASK 8 

The final interface method to implement is `savePostAsTextFile()`. This should call the `saveAsTextFile()` method from your `Post` class to save a given post.

In your `TestMBLoadApp.java` file add code to find the post with subject including search term `windows`, and to save the first matching post (there should be only one!) as test file `windowspost.txt`. Catch and handle the exceptions as above i.e.

```java
try {
        // code to save the post
} catch( IOException ex ) {
        System.out.println("File not saved.");
        ex.printStackTrace();
}
```

One this is working edit the `MessageBoard` definition to specify it `implements MessageBoardInterface` and check it compiles without errors.

### `package messageboard;`

#### TASK 9

The final task is to arrange your work into a java project folder structure and prepare a jar fileto distribute your code as a java package `messageboard`.

Clean up your directory by deleting the `.class` files. Then:

 - create folders `src` `bin` `doc` `build` `res` `TestSystem`

 - move test program files into `TestSystem`
 
 - add `package messageboard;` lines at top of messageboard `.java` files
 
 - store `.java` files stored in `messageboard` package directory within `src`
 
 - rebuild the `.class` binaries storing to `bin` folder

```sh
javac -d bin -cp bin src/messageboard/*.java
```

 - create jar file in `build` folder called `mboard_v1.0.jar` containing package binaries.

```sh
jar cvf ./build/mboard_v1.0.jar -C bin .
```

 - you can test your package with your test programs. Note you will have to add line `import messageboard.*;` to the top of your files to import the package.

 ```sh
javac -cp ./build/mboard_v1.0.jar ./TestSystem/*.java
java -cp ./build/mboard_v1.0.jar:TestSystem TestMBApp
java -cp ./build/mboard_v1.0.jar:TestSystem TestMBLoadApp
 ```

Well done! You have finished workshop 9.

You can test your system using a (basic) text user interface.

Follow the instructions below to test your system...

 - First download the additional files with code to run the frontend of the system (Message Board user interface and test application). This interfaces with your code by using the methods defined in the `MessageBoardInterface.java` file:

```sh
curl -O -J -L https://github.com/My-UofE/ECM1410-Workshop-09-Instructions/raw/refs/heads/main/TestUI.zip
unzip -o TestUI.zip; rm TestUI.zip
```

You can compile these using the MessageBoard class stored in your `jar` file and run the resulting applciation:

```sh
javac -cp ./build/mboard_v1.0.jar ./TestUI/*.java
java -cp ./build/mboard_v1.0.jar:TestUI TestMBUIApp
```

Try to test all the possible functions to verify your code works as expected.

Make sure you commit and push your work to the GitHub classroom so that it can be graded, and that you have followed the steps in the instructions as directed.
